# AP Physics C - Homework 0B - Differentiation

This set of problems is designed to help you master how to solve problems using calculus methods.  The focus here is on practical problem solving and big picture concepts rather than understanding the detailed mathematical principles and theorems (that is a problem for your calculus instructor).

Be sure to show all work for each question.

## Questions

### Tangent Lines and Derivatives

1. Use the following graph to evaluate (a) $f^\prime (-3)$ and (b) $f^\prime(1.5)$

   ![A graph with a flat line until x=1, then goes up](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250522.165258/resources/2cdeca421ebb6f9f87b98e24294d2bd84a031b26)

2. By annotation or otherwise, explain how you would find $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}$ at $x=-1$ for the following graph:

   ![A function with multiple ups and downs](https://openstax.org/apps/image-cdn/v1/f=webp/apps/archive/20250522.165258/resources/a06a976db20b7be57aa97e649bd4ef7bcd064ee9)

### Finding Derivatives Using Rules

Differentiate each of the following functions:

3. $f(x)=5x^3-x+1$
4. $f(x) = 8x^4 + 9x^2 -1$
5. $\displaystyle y(x) = \frac{1}{x}+\cos x$
6. $y(x) = (3x^2 + 1)^3$
7. $y(x) = -6(\sin x)^{-3}$
8. $y(x) = \cos^3 (\pi x)$ (hint: you will want to use the chain rule *twice*)

### Higher Derivatives and Applications

9. A model rocket is fired vertically upward from the ground. The distance $s$ in feet that the rocket travels from the ground after $t$ seconds is given by $s(t)=âˆ’16t^2+560t$. (Hint: review the definition of velocity and acceleration in terms of derivatives in Young and Freedman, Ch. 2.2 and 2.3)
   1. Find the velocity of the rocket 3 seconds after being fired.
   2. Find the acceleration of the rocket 3 seconds after being fired.

### Identifying Maxima and Minima

Find the local minima/maxima for the following functions:

10. $\displaystyle y = \frac{1}{x-1}$
11. $y = \sqrt{4-x^2}$
